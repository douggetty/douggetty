I'm a cognitive scientist ðŸ§ , data scientist ðŸ“ˆ, and lover R. I created a personal website to showcase all three of these interests. The website has links to my academic research, Resume + CV, as well as blog posts that show R skills that I have been working on, statistical concepts I've been muddying through, and more. 

Here are some resources I've found helpful to create this blog:

  - [This super helpful tutorial on getting started from Allison Presmanes-Hill ](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/)
  - [This post on how to embed a shiny app into a post](https://statsandr.com/blog/how-to-embed-a-shiny-app-in-blogdown/)


I also really enjoy the Tidy Tuesday challenges put on the by the R for Data Science (R4DS) community. I've participated in more than I've actually posted on my blog, but I always like the challenge of working with data in new domains. If you're interested in participating yourself, new datasets are posted weekly on their [Github here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
