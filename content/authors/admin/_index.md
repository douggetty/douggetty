I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at McGraw Hill. Before that, I was Graduate Student Researcher at the University of Pittsburgh where I trained with Dr. Scott Fraundorf. My research focused on language comprehension and conversation. I had a particular focus investigating how comprehenders obtain non-literal interpretations of noisy language input.
