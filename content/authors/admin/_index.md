I'm currently a Graduate Student Researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. My research interests include language processing, quantitative methods, and second language acquisition. I am currently most focused on projects investigating how comprehenders obtain non-literal interpretations of language input, but I am interested in exploring whether and the ability to gain non-literal interpretations of language connects to broader phenomena such as misinformation, text (mis)comprehension, and memory.
